These are the scripts are used to create the charged separated WW->munuqqbar distributions.
They are modified versions of the scripts I got from Robert Karl.
I executed them on my DUST directory and they probably contain a bunch of hardcoded directory paths.
If you use these scripts, take care to change those paths!

Also please consider running them on DUST again, it produces a significantly large output.
